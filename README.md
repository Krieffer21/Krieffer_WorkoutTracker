# Unit 17 Nosql Homework: Workout Tracker
  This assignment was to create a workout tracker. I was provided with the front end code and wrote the backend code. I used a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handled routes with Express.

## api Route
  The screenshot below is the api route for adding an exercise. It adds the duration of the current exercise to the previous exercises. This will let the user know the total duradtion of their workout.

## html Route
  The screenshot of the html routes below shows the paths I created to direct the user accordingly.
