# Unit 17 Nosql Homework: Workout Tracker
  This assignment was to create a workout tracker. I was provided with the front end code and wrote the backend code. I used a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handled routes with Express.

## API Route
  The screenshot below is the api route for adding an exercise to the users workout. This also calculates the users total workout duration as exercises are added.

## HTML Route
  The screenshot of the html routes below shows the paths I created to direct the user accordingly.

  In the gifs below it shows the fuctioning application. I can add exercises to a previous workout plan or new exercises to a new workout plan, and view the multiple combined weight of multiple exercises on the stats page.
